# Island Integration — Static Site (Core Files)

This bundle includes the "core files" separated:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `public/logo.png`, `public/hero-poster.jpg`
- `public/services/*.jpg` and `.webp` placeholders for all 9 services

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Upload everything in this zip to your repo root (so `index.html` is at the top level).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → Branch: main, Folder: /(root).

## Add your own images
Place your photos in `public/services/` with these basenames: 
lighting, cinema, shading, design, climate, multiroom, security, wifi, support
Use any of: .avif, .webp, .jpg, .png (the script picks the first that actually exists).
