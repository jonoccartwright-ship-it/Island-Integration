# Island Integration — Pure Static Bundle (GitHub Pages Ready)

**Only these files/folders are needed in your repo root:**
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `public/`
  - `logo.png`
  - `hero-poster.jpg`
  - `services/` (put your real images here)

**Do NOT include build system files** like `src/`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.

**Deploy**
- Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → main / (root)

**Service photo basenames**
lighting, cinema, shading, design, climate, multiroom, security, wifi, support
Use any of: .avif, .webp, .jpg, .png — the script probes in that order and picks what exists.
